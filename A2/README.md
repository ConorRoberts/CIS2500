To compile, run 'make all'. To run, use './a2_q1' or './a2_q2'. Q1a: Rows can be accessed using a single coordinate of the 2D array. Q1b: Columns cannot be indexed by using only one coordinate of the 2d array. Q2c: Changes made to a_deep do not affect any other structure. Q2d: Pointers have to be freed to prevent memory leaks. They must be freed in the reverse order to which they were created. Only a1 and a_deep must be freed because all of the other pointers are linked to a1.
