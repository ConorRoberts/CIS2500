Q1: Reads given text and prints letter frequencies along with character/letter count. Usage "./frequency_table {-F file.txt} ". Q2: Expands on Q1 by attempting to decode an encoded message using the provided chi_sq formula. Q3: Takes in binary records and decodes the string portions. To reverse the records, I started reading the binary data from the end of the file instead of the start. SEEK_END in fseek() does this very easily. From there I incremented the pointer by -sizeof(struct record) to step backwards from the end until the beginning of the data was reached.
